My name is Vanessa Arriaga, and I am a senior Technology Management major from Longview, TX. Throughout my time at A&amp;M, I have been able to discover and understand many aspects of technology, and apply that knowledge in the real world. In the future, I hope to enter the product design field or UX field to create accessible and user-friendly products and software. <br /><br />
